## Hi there 👋

Im Hamed, a .Net developer student based in Sweden Eskilstuna.

My main goal is to become a full stack dev but currently my tech stack is C# and a little bit of JavaScript.

I try to build as many projects for fun and leaning beside my studies, currently im working on my first project to ship.

I got some of my projects on here and my favorit is Cops&Theives.

Fun facts: 
- I have a Australien rainbowlorikeet (parrot) to keep me company while i work!
- I like to go to the gym
- I am an animal lover
